# CLAUDE.md

## How to work
- Read ACE_TASK.md fully before acting; follow steps in order.
- Prefer minimal changes; keep commits tight and focused when asked.
- Ask clarifying questions in the GitHub issue if requirements are unclear.
- When blocked by credentials or missing services, leave a concise issue comment.
- Always format code with repo standards; run available linters/tests when practical.

## Tooling
- You are running inside tmux; logs are captured. Keep output concise.
- MCP servers: GitHub (official) and Appforge MCP for project board filtering.
- GitHub token is injected as GITHUB_TOKEN.

## Delivery
- Summarize changes at the end (what, why, tests).
- If no changes made, state that explicitly with the reason.
